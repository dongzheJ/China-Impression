        <p>Huangshan is a mountain range in southern Anhui province in eastern China. Vegetation on the range is thickest below 1,100 meters (3,600 ft), with trees growing up to the treeline at 1,800 meters (5,900 ft).</p>
        <p>Huangshan is known for its sunrises, pine trees,"strangely jutting granite peaks", hot springs, winter snow, and views of clouds touching the mountainsides for more than 197 days out of the year.</p>
        <p>The Huangshan mountain range has many peaks, some more than 1,000 meters (3,250 feet) high.The three tallest and best-known peaks are Lotus Peak (Lian Hua Feng, 1,864 m), Bright Summit Peak (Guang Ming Ding, 1,840 m), and Celestial Peak (Tian Du Feng, literally Capital of Heaven Peak, 1,829 m).[2][5] The World Heritage Site covers a core area of 154 square kilometres and a buffer zone of 142 square kilometres.[8] The mountains were formed in the Mesozoic, approximately 100 million years ago, when an ancient sea disappeared due to uplift.Later, in the Quaternary Period, the landscape was shaped by the influence of glaciers.</p>
        <p>The vegetation of the area varies with elevation. Mesic forests cover the landscape below 1,100 meters. Deciduous forest stretches from 1,100 meters up to the tree line at 1,800 meters. Above that point, the vegetation consists of alpine grasslands. The area has diverse flora, where one-third of China's bryophyte families and more than half of its fern families are represented. The Huangshan pine (Pinus hwangshanensis) is named after Huangshan and is considered an example of vigor because the trees thrive by growing straight out of the rocks. Many of the pine trees in the area are more than a hundred years old and have been given their own names (such as the Ying Ke Pine, or Welcoming-Guests Pine, which is thought to be more than 1500 years old).The pines vary greatly in shape and size, with the most crooked of the trees being considered the most attractive. Furthermore, Huangshan's moist climate facilitates the growing of tea leaves, and the mountain has been called "one of China's premier green tea-growing mountains. Mao feng cha ("Fur Peak Tea"), a well-known local variety of green tea, takes its name from the downy tips of tea leaves found in the Huangshan area.</p>

        <p>Huangshan was formed approximately 100 million years ago and gained its unique rock formations in the Quaternary Glaciation.</p>
        <p>During the Qin Dynasty, Huangshan was known as Yishan (Mount Yi). In 747 AD, its name was changed to Huangshan (Mount Huang) by imperial decree; the name is commonly thought to have been coined in honor of Huang Di (the Yellow Emperor), a legendary Chinese emperor, and the mythological ancestor of the Han Chinese.One legend states that Huangshan was the location from which the Yellow Emperor ascended to Heaven.Another legend states that the Yellow Emperor "cultivated moral character and refined Pills of Immortality in the mountains, and in so doing gave the mountains his name. The first use of this name "Huangshan" often is attributed to Chinese poet Li Bai. Huangshan was fairly inaccessible and little-known in ancient times, but its change of name in 747 AD seems to have brought the area more attention; from then on, the area was visited frequently and many temples were built there.</p>
        <p>Huangshan is known for its stone steps, carved into the side of the mountain, of which there may be more than 60,000 throughout the area. The date at which work on the steps began is unknown, but they have been said to be more than 1,500 years old.</p>
        <p>Over the years, many scenic spots and physical features on the mountain have been named; many of the names have narratives behind them. For example, one legend tells of a man who did not believe the tales of Huangshan's beauty and went to the mountains to see them; almost immediately, he was converted to the same view. One of the peaks he is said to have visited was named Shixin , roughly meaning "start to believe."</p>

        <p>In 1982, Huangshan was declared a "site of scenic beauty and historic interest" by the State Council of the People's Republic of China.It was named a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1990 for its scenery and for its role as a habitat for rare and threatened species.</p>

            <p>In 2002, Huangshan was named the "sister mountain" of Jungfrau in the Swiss Alps.</p>
