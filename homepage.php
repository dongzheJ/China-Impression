    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Whether you are looking for ancient history, urban wonders, picturesque landscapes, or cultural experiences; more and more world travelers are turning their toes towards China. For first time travelers to this beautiful and historic land, here are some facts you may wish to know.
        China is located in eastern Asia along the western shore of the Pacific Ocean. It spreads over a vastly diverse geographical area of 9.6 million square kilometers (about the size of the USA or Europe), and is home to approaching 1.4 billion people (more than N. America and Europe combined).
        The highlands and hill regions account for 65 percent of the country's total landmass, and there are more than 2,000 lakes dotting the landscape. The highest mountain peak is  (Mt. Everest) in Tibet, the highest in the world, 8,848 meters above sea level.
        Among the 220,000 kilometers of rivers the Changjiang， Huanghe，  and Zhujiang (Pearl River) are the most famous. The Yellow River Basin is the cradle of Chinese civilization, as the many cultural-historical sites along its banks can attest.
        Most of China has a continental climate, though it has an ocean coast, and latitudes range from tropical to Siberian, meaning that temperatures and weather differ strikingly across the country.
        For example, northernmost  Province has long winters and short summers, while  Island in the south boasts the exact opposite. Likewise, the Huai River valley (between the Yellow and Yangtze rivers) is marked by distinctive seasonal changes, but the southern province of  is famous for its perpetual spring.
        China's immense size and unique geography means that travelers will need to pay extra attention to climate and weather as they pack.
        Since the 1980's, China has been drawing increasing amounts of Western visitors eager to explore its beauty and culture. While there are some , most travelers find the country easy to navigate and well worth effort. Beijing, Shanghai, Guilin, Xi'an, and Hong Kong are the five best-known tourist cities in China.
